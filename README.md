[Mortality Trend Analysis](projects/AndrewBilew%20(1).ipynb) Preprocessed and reshaped over a century of mortality data (mortality_prepped.pkl, mortality_wide.pkl) to long and wide formats; calculated mean-centered death rates by age group and visualized trends with pandas and seaborn.

[Avocado Market Analytics](projects/AndrewBilew_Exam.ipynb) Imported and cleansed avocado.csv; used .iloc slicing to inspect specific rows/columns, calculated a new EstimatedRevenue column (Total Volume Ã— AveragePrice), and segmented data by year and region for deeper insights.

[Bank Loan Prediction](projects/AndrewBilew_assignment6.ipynb) Worked with UniversalBank.csv to explore client demographics and financial behaviors, performed feature engineering and scaling, then trained and evaluated K-Nearest Neighbors and logistic regression models to predict personal loan uptake with high accuracy.

[Stock Price Time Series](projects/AndrewBilew_assignment4-1.ipynb) Loaded ExxonMobil stock data (XOM.CSV), converted Date to datetime index, and generated time-series visualizations of open/close prices and trading volume to uncover market patterns.
